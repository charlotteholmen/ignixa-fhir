Labels: [Architecture](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/labels/Architecture) | [API](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/labels/Area-API) | [Search](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server/labels/Area-Search)

## Context

Healthcare organizations split datasets across multiple FHIR servers for a variety of reasons - to segment data, for performance, or for capacity reasons. However, applications frequently need to query data across these distributed FHIR servers to get a comprehensive view of patient information or gain exploritory insights across multiple datasets.

## Decision

We will implement a **Fanout Broker Query Service** that acts as a FHIR-compliant proxy to aggregate search queries across multiple running FHIR servers in a Read-only capacity. This layer will be independent and not built into the main API or Web projects. The service will:

### Core Functionality
- **Accept and process only Search operations** at system level (`GET /?[search]`) and resource type level (`GET /[ResourceType]/[search]`)
- **Reject point read queries** (e.g., `GET /Patient/123`) and return appropriate HTTP 501 Not Implemented responses
- **Reject all Create, Update, Delete (CUD) operations** and return HTTP 405 Method Not Allowed responses
- **Expose its own read-only CapabilityStatement** that accurately reflects supported operations and search parameters
- **FHIR Version** all underlying servers must be a single FHIR Spec version (R4).

### Search Operation Handling
- **Adaptive query execution strategy** that selects between parallel and sequential execution based on search parameters and expected result patterns:
    - **Parallel execution** for queries targeting specific resources with low expected result counts (e.g., `_id=123`, `identifier=specific-value`, exact matches)
    - **Sequential execution** for broad queries with potentially high result counts (e.g., `name=John`, `status=active`, pattern matches) where a single server instance may fill the requested page size
- **Query pattern analysis** to automatically determine optimal execution strategy based on search parameter types and values
- **Result aggregation** from multiple servers into a single FHIR Bundle response with intelligent merging
- **Duplicate resource handling** where resources with identical logical IDs from different servers are all returned, differentiated by their `fullUrl` values
- **FullUrl differentiation** using a pattern like `{source-server-base-url}/{resourceType}/{id}` to maintain traceability to source systems
- **Early termination** for sequential queries when sufficient results are obtained to satisfy the requested `_count` parameter

### Advanced Search Features
- **Include/RevInclude support** through configurable resolution strategies (see Resolution Strategies section)
- **Chained search expressions** support for queries like `Patient?organization.name=Acme` or `Observation?subject:Patient.name=John`:
    - **Forward chaining**: Follow references from source to target resources (e.g., `Observation?subject.name=John`)
    - **Reverse chaining**: Use `_has` parameter to find resources that are referenced by others (e.g., `Patient?_has:Observation:subject:code=vital-signs`)
    - **Multi-level chaining**: Support nested chains across multiple reference levels
    - **Configurable resolution**: Support both co-located and distributed reference resolution (see Resolution Strategies section)
    - **Chain timeout protection**: Implement configurable timeouts (15 seconds default) for chained sub-queries to prevent resource exhaustion
- **Sorting support** with parallel execution across all servers and intelligent continuation token management:
    - **First page**: Request `_count` results (sorted) from each server, re-sort globally, return top `_count` results
    - **Subsequent pages**: Decipher aggregated continuation token to per-server tokens, request next `_count` from each server, re-sort globally, return next `_count` results
    - **Continuation token aggregation**: Combine per-server continuation tokens into single client token for seamless paging
- **Standard search parameters** support including `_count`, `_sort`, `_elements`, `_include`, `_revInclude`, `_summary`, `_id`, `_lastModified`, and resource-specific search parameters

### Execution Strategy Decision Matrix
The service determines execution strategy based on search parameter analysis:

**Parallel Execution Triggers:**
- Exact ID searches (`_id=123`, `_id=123,456,789`)
- Specific identifier searches (`identifier=system|value`)
- Unique business identifiers (SSN, MRN with system)
- Small result set modifiers (`_count=1-10`)
- **All queries with `_sort` parameter** (requires parallel execution across all servers for proper global sorting)
- **Chained search sub-queries** (chain resolution requires comprehensive collection across all servers)
- Queries likely to return < 500 results per server

**Sequential Execution Triggers:**
- Broad text searches (`name=John`, `family=Smith`)
- Status-based searches (`status=active`, `category=medication`)
- Date range searches without specific identifiers
- Queries likely to return > 500 results per server
- Large `_count` values (> 20)
- Service will use a "fill-factor" of 0.5, it should continue searching until we retrieve at least 50% of the requested result count (as done in Cosmos implementation).

**Hybrid Execution:**
- Complex queries may use parallel execution for specific parameters and sequential for broad ones
- **Include/RevInclude operations always use parallel queries** regardless of primary strategy, as they require comprehensive collection of referenced resources across all servers and cannot be paged
- **Chained search operations use hybrid approach**: sub-queries for chain resolution execute in parallel across all servers, while primary query may use sequential execution based on other criteria
- Secondary _id-based queries for includes use parallel execution to ensure all referenced resources are collected immediately

### Sorting Algorithm and Continuation Token Management
For queries with `_sort` parameter, the service implements a distributed sorting algorithm:

**First Page Request (`_count=N`):**
1. Request `N` sorted results from each FHIR server simultaneously
2. Merge and re-sort all results globally using the specified sort criteria
3. Select the top `N` results for the response
4. Calculate new per-server continuation tokens based on the last returned result from each server
5. Aggregate per-server continuation tokens into a single client continuation token
6. Return the top `N` results with the aggregated continuation token

**Subsequent Page Requests:**
1. Decipher the aggregated continuation token to extract per-server continuation tokens
2. Request next `N` sorted results from each FHIR server using their respective continuation tokens
3. Merge and re-sort all newly retrieved results globally
4. Select the next `N` results for the response
5. Calculate updated per-server continuation tokens based on the last returned result from each server
6. Aggregate updated continuation tokens into a new client continuation token
7. Return the next `N` results with the new aggregated continuation token

**Continuation Token Format:**
```json
{
  "servers": [
    {"endpoint": "server1", "token": "server1_continuation_token"},
    {"endpoint": "server2", "token": "server2_continuation_token"},
    {"endpoint": "serverN", "token": "serverN_continuation_token"}
  ],
  "sort_criteria": "_lastUpdated,desc",
  "page_size": 50
}
```

### Resolution Strategies for Chained Searches and Includes

The service supports configurable resolution strategies to handle different data distribution patterns across FHIR servers:

#### **Passthrough Resolution (Default)**
*For scenarios where resources and their references are co-located on the same servers*

- **Behavior**: Assumes that referenced resources exist on the same servers as the referencing resources
- **Performance**: Optimal - minimal cross-server queries
- **Use Case**: Legacy deployments, data co-location by design
- **Chained Search**: `DiagnosticReport?subject:Patient.name=Sarah` executes Patient sub-query on same servers that have DiagnosticReports
- **Includes**: `Patient?name=John&_include=Patient:organization` assumes Organizations exist on same servers as Patients

#### **Distributed Resolution**
*For scenarios where resources and their references are distributed across multiple shards*

- **Behavior**: Executes comprehensive cross-shard resolution for chained searches and includes
- **Performance**: Higher latency but complete coverage across all servers
- **Use Case**: True sharding deployments where related resources may be on different servers
- **Chained Search Process**:
  1. **Phase 1**: Execute `Patient?name=Sarah` across ALL servers to collect Patient IDs
  2. **Phase 2**: Execute `DiagnosticReport?subject=patient1,patient2,patient3...` across all servers
- **Include Resolution Process**:
  1. **Phase 1**: Execute primary search across servers
  2. **Phase 2**: Extract all reference IDs from results
  3. **Phase 3**: Execute `_id=id1,id2,id3...` queries across ALL servers for each referenced resource type

#### **Configuration-Driven Selection**

```json
{
  "FanoutBroker": {
    "ChainedSearchResolution": "Passthrough",  // or "Distributed"
    "IncludeResolution": "Passthrough",        // or "Distributed"
    "DistributedChainTimeoutSeconds": 15,
    "DistributedIncludeTimeoutSeconds": 10,
    "MaxDistributedReferenceIds": 1000,
    "DistributedBatchSize": 100,
    "EnableDistributedResolutionCache": true
  }
}
```

#### **Mixed Mode Support**
The service supports different resolution strategies for chained searches versus includes:

```json
{
  "ChainedSearchResolution": "Distributed",  // Chains cross shards
  "IncludeResolution": "Passthrough"         // Includes are co-located
}
```

#### **Performance Optimizations for Distributed Resolution**
- **Caching**: Chain resolution results cached for 5 minutes to avoid redundant sub-queries
- **Batching**: Large reference ID lists split into configurable batch sizes (default: 100)
- **Parallel Execution**: All cross-shard queries executed in parallel to minimize latency
- **Timeout Protection**: Configurable timeouts prevent resource exhaustion

#### **Resolution Strategy Decision Matrix**

| Data Distribution Pattern | Chained Search Strategy | Include Strategy | Rationale |
|---------------------------|------------------------|------------------|-----------|
| **Co-located by Design** | Passthrough | Passthrough | Optimal performance, references guaranteed local |
| **Patient-Centric Sharding** | Distributed | Passthrough | Patients distributed, but their references co-located |
| **Resource-Type Sharding** | Distributed | Distributed | Different resource types on different servers |
| **Hybrid Distribution** | Distributed | Distributed | Mixed patterns require comprehensive resolution |

### Architecture Components
- **Query Router**: Distributes search queries to configured FHIR server endpoints using adaptive execution strategies
- **Execution Strategy Analyzer**: Determines whether to use parallel or sequential execution based on search parameter analysis
- **Resolution Strategy Factory**: Creates appropriate resolution strategies (Passthrough or Distributed) based on configuration
- **Passthrough Resolution Strategy**: Handles chained searches and includes assuming co-located references (current behavior)
- **Distributed Resolution Strategy**: Executes comprehensive cross-shard resolution for chained searches and includes
- **Distributed Resolution Cache**: Caches chain resolution results to optimize repeated sub-queries
- **Result Aggregator**: Combines responses from multiple servers into unified FHIR Bundles with intelligent merging and deduplication
- **CapabilityStatement Provider**: Generates read-only capability statements based on intersection of target server capabilities
- **Configuration Service**: Manages the list of target FHIR servers, their endpoints, authentication details, and resolution strategy settings

## Status
Proposed

## Consequences

### Positive Impacts
- **Simplified Client Integration**: Applications can query multiple FHIR servers through a single endpoint, reducing complexity in client code
- **Improved Data Accessibility**: Enables comprehensive searches across distributed healthcare data without requiring clients to manage multiple connections
- **Consistent API Experience**: Provides a standard FHIR-compliant interface regardless of the number or configuration of backend servers
- **Optimized Performance**: Adaptive execution strategy provides optimal response times - parallel for targeted queries, sequential for broad searches
- **Resource Efficiency**: Sequential execution prevents overwhelming servers with broad queries while parallel execution ensures comprehensive coverage for specific searches

### Potential Drawbacks
- **Increased Infrastructure Complexity**: Introduces another service layer that requires deployment, monitoring, and maintenance
- **Adaptive Strategy Complexity**: Execution strategy decision-making adds computational overhead and potential for suboptimal choices
- **Resource Consumption**: Aggregating large result sets from multiple servers can consume significant memory and CPU resources
- **Limited Write Operations**: Read-only nature will require clients to maintain separate write connections to individual

### Impact on Existing FHIR Server Architecture
- **No Breaking Changes**: Implementation will extend existing architecture without modifying core FHIR server functionality
- **Reusable Components**: Leverages existing search infrastructure, authentication, and capability statement generation
- **Consistent Patterns**: Follows established patterns for capability providers and search services
- **Extension Points**: Creates new extension points for custom aggregation strategies and server selection logic

This decision enables healthcare organizations to provide unified access to distributed FHIR data while maintaining compliance with FHIR specifications.

## Limitations
- Can only work with Search Parameters that are supported by all underlying FHIR servers.
- All underlying FHIR servers must be of the same FHIR version (R4).
- Does not support write operations (Create, Update, Delete).
