# Feature Development Workflow

This folder contains feature areas organized using a structured investigation-to-decision workflow.

## Quick Reference

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/fn-feature {name}` | Create a new feature area |
| `/fn-investigation {feature} {topic}` | Add an investigation to explore an approach |
| `/fn-adr {feature}` | Synthesize viable investigations into a proposed ADR |
| `/fn-accept {feature} {adr-filename}` | Move implemented ADR to `docs/adr/` |
| `/fn-reject {feature} {investigation}` | Mark an investigation as rejected |

## Workflow

```
1. /fn-feature bulk-export
   └── Creates docs/features/bulk-export/readme.md

2. /fn-investigation bulk-export channel-based
   └── Creates docs/features/bulk-export/investigations/channel-based.md

3. /fn-investigation bulk-export streaming-export
   └── Creates docs/features/bulk-export/investigations/streaming-export.md

4. /fn-adr bulk-export
   └── Creates docs/features/bulk-export/adr-2512-bulk-export.md

5. (Implement the feature)

6. /fn-accept bulk-export adr-2512-bulk-export
   └── Moves to docs/adr/adr-2512-bulk-export.md
```

## Folder Structure

├── readme.md                    # This file

```

## Naming Conventions

| Item | Convention | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| Feature folder | kebab-case | `bulk-import`, `smart-on-fhir` |
| Investigation file | kebab-case, descriptive | `import-operation.md`, `channel-based.md` |
| ADR file | `adr-{YYMM}-{topic}.md` | `adr-2512-bulk-export.md` |

## Investigation Status Values

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `In Progress` | Currently being researched |
| `Viable` | Research complete, approach is valid |
| `Complete` | Research complete, ready for ADR synthesis |
| `Merged` | Incorporated into accepted ADR and implemented |
| `Rejected` | Not viable (use `/fn-reject` to document why) |

## Feature Status Values

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `Exploring` | Initial investigation phase |
| `Proposed` | ADR drafted, awaiting implementation |
| `Decided` | ADR accepted, implementation in progress |
| `Partial Implementation` | Some parts implemented |
| `Complete` | Fully implemented and accepted |

## Investigation File Template

```markdown
# Investigation: {Topic}

**Feature**: {feature-name}
**Status**: In Progress
**Created**: {YYYY-MM-DD}

## Approach
{What would we build, how would it work?}

## Tradeoffs

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| {benefit} | {drawback} |

## Alignment

- [ ] Follows layer rules (API -> App -> Domain -> Data)
- [ ] F5 Developer Experience (works with minimal setup)
- [ ] FHIR spec compliance (if applicable)
- [ ] Consistent with existing patterns

## Evidence
{Research findings, code exploration, prior art}

## Verdict
*Pending evaluation*
```

## Tips for Claude Code

1. **Starting a new feature**: Use `/fn-feature {name}` first, then add investigations
2. **Multiple approaches**: Create separate investigation files for each approach
3. **Ready to decide**: When investigations are complete, use `/fn-adr` to synthesize
4. **After implementation**: Use `/fn-accept` to finalize the ADR
5. **Dead ends**: Use `/fn-reject` to document why an approach didn't work
